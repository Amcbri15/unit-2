Today we'll be working more on Unit 1 basics.

#### Hans Demo

#### Unit 1 Assessment

Please pull [the lastest version](https://github.com/accesscode-2-1/unit-1-assessment) of the Unit 1 Assessment and complete it, continuing where you left off last Tuesday.
The bug in the 4th Java test has been fixed. When you're done with the assessment, please update your pull request.

#### Bonus
> 1. Create a TicTacToe program with a Board class and Player interface (and other classes as needed). Create a HumanPlayer class which implements the Player interface and asks for user input to play. Create a ComputerPlayer class which implements the player input and makes moves as an AI. Run the game with two ComputerPlayers playing against each other. Play the game as a HumanPlayer against the ComputerPlayer.

> 2. Turn your TicTacToe code into an Android app where a user can play against the machine (ComputerPlayer).
