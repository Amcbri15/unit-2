#### Exercise (Afternoon)

Working in your homework groups:

1. Build an application using a [ListView](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/listview.html). Use
an adapter to populate the ListView with a list in the XML resouces.

1. Build an application using a [GridView](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/gridview.html) Use an
adapater to populate the GridView with a list in the XML resources.

1. Using an app you've already created, refactor the code to use either a ListView or a GridView in place of your
current view.

#### Bonus (Afternoon)

Create a custom adapter and use this in an application you've already created.
