### Storing Files

#### Objective

Students will understand how to store data using shared preferences and internal and external storage.

#### Do Now (Morning)

> Create a `User` class. A User has a name and an age. Create a constructor and getters and setters for this object, and override toString so that it returns "$name, $age".

> Create an app with one main activity. The activity should include an EditText that takes in a user's name and
> a number representing the user's age, a submission button, and a spinner (dropdown), which we will later populate with `Users`.

> When a user hits the submit button, use the name and age fields to create a `User` object with that name and age. Store the `Users` in an array that populates the spinner.

#### Lesson (Morning)

##### Shared Preferences

> Exercise

> Add a `total_users` counter to your app. Every time a user gets added, increment this value and toast how many users you've seen. Store/retrieve `total_users` in shared preferences so that this number always increases across uses.
